The blog has been down for a ~long~ time, as you may have noticed. Most of my personal sites have fallen into various states of disrepair, and I migrated things over to a new server, which took everything down permanently until I found the time to restore things.

But now we're back! You may still notice some broken links or what have you around the place; let me know when you discover these and I will try to fix them as soon as I can.
