Hey everyone! Sorry about the placeholder entry earlier today; I got caught up in hanging out with my sister (and making some *delicious* pork ribs) and totally forgot about the blog entirely. Won't happen **ever again.** I think I went a little too far yesterday with regards to length, so I'll be doing some shorter entries to prevent myself from getting too long-winded. Since it's so late today, I'll just post some links and leave the meaty material for tomorrow. Apologies!

[**Sean Carroll explains in easy-to-understand terms the physics on why there is something rather than nothing**](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/) - Every time I hear about modern physics I always come away with a deep appreciation for the work that these men and women do. In many ways I regret not studying physics in more depth at college. (h/t to [Phil Plait over at Bad Astronomy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/05/03/why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/) for this one)

[**Peter Theil's CS183: Startup class in essay form**](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/tagged/cs183) - I'll be following this really closely. Startup life is something I've been pretty interested in, and it's really rare to get a free glimpse into a veteran's wisdom like this.

[**TU Munich's Mathematics department cancels its Elsevier subscriptions**](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/the-mathematics-department-at-tu-munich-cancels-its-subscriptions-to-elsevier-journals/) - This needs to happen more often. I'm glad that Harvard put out a strongly-worded statement against the worst practices of academic journals and publishers, but in the end what's needed to achieve real change is action to impact their bottom line.

[**Health Affairs outlines why drug shortages happen**](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2012/05/02/drug-shortages-why-a-government-stockpile-falls-short-as-a-solution/) - The implications of how sensitive our stockpiles are to the shutdowns of individual factories are *really* scary.
