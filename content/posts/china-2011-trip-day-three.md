Today we went to take some professional photos as a family.

It took eleven hours.

Thoughts:

- Being a professional model must be incredibly hard. Christ.
- The line between modernized and "old style" Beijing - red walls, sloped ridged green roofs, the like - is just that, a line that you can draw. It's pretty jarring.
- I feel like the "blue sky" record that Beijing recently was proclaimed as having broken must have had a pretty loose definition of a "blue sky".
- Once again, I am reminded of how easily your social norms can be warped beyond recognition without your realising it.
