This year my current employer, Grand Rounds, sent a bunch of its developers to [GraphQL Summit in SF](https://web.archive.org/web/20171009200749/https://summit.graphql.com/)! GraphQL Summit is a conference for the GraphQL development community to come together and talk about the stuff we've been working on using GraphQL, and the challenges we've been facing. GraphQL [has been around for a few years now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) but has really taken off recently, so as it turns out even the folks evangelizing it are figuring out how to tackle e.g. authorization right there alongside everyone else.

This was the second tech conference I'd been to, the previous one being [Github Universe](https://web.archive.org/web/20171015082043/https://githubuniverse.com/) which happened just two weeks before GraphQL Summit, so I was (and am!) still super new to the whole conference thing and figuring out how to get the most out of the experience. Here were a few things I've learned so far.

one of the best things to do is meet people
-------------------------------------------

follow-up after talks is super important
----------------------------------------

some types of talks are really hard to give in a useful way
-----------------------------------------------------------

lightning talks are particularly hard
-------------------------------------

technical lectures at a conference can be great
-----------------------------------------------

live demos are scary as heck
----------------------------

a little bit of planning ahead goes a long way
----------------------------------------------
