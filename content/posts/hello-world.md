So this blog has been dead for the longest time! I've just now gotten to reviving it and have resolved to make one post every day from now on, no matter what it's about. I'll try to stick to the stuff that's in my Google Reader and side projects I'm working on, so that'll primarily be US policy and Rails/Python development.

Anyways, just wanted to touch base with y'all. The site will be pretty ugly for awhile (I think it's sort-of passable now) so please bear with me, and please look forward to the posts from now on!
