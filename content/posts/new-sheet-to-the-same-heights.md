Er, once in awhile I run into a piece I hear that’s not designed for piano solo. So I arrange it for the solo piano (usually by cutting the heart and soul out of the piece).

One such example I just finished with. “To The Same Heights”, or “同じ高みへ”, from the anime / visual novel [Clannad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clannad_(visual_novel)), was originally designed as a piano duet. I spent a day slaving away on Sibelius to bring you this (admittedly awkward) arrangement for the solo piano. If anyone knows how to make the left hand less awkward please, for the love of God, tell me.

[Here](http://seinmastudios.com/arrangements/to%20the%20same%20heights.pdf) is the score in PDF format. And [here’s](http://seinmastudios.com/arrangements/to%20the%20same%20heights.mid) the MIDI file for previewing.

Enjoy! And please, comment on what I can improve. I only dabble in arranging, so if anything needs fixing please let me know!
