*This post is part of a series on our family vacation in Europe. If you haven't, you should definitely start from the beginning [here](http://seinmastudios.com/on-our-summer-family-trip-to-europe-prelude).*

Our flight out of Minneapolis was in the evening. This allowed my father to get some work done early in the day before we left, and it meant that we'd arrive in Paris early in the morning after a flight lasting slightly less than eight hours. The flight over, handled by Air France, was pretty unremarkable; I feel asleep early in the flight, and managed to get about an hour or two of shuteye before my parents woke me up trying to make me comfortable. After that, I wasn't able to fall back asleep; I spend nearly the whole trip reading the book I'd brought, and glad that I'd picked something that was several hundred pages.

The most striking thing on the flight was the quantity and quality of the meals offered: on US airlines, it's always sort of hit-or-miss as to whether or not you'll be offered a meal, and when you are offered one, it's almost always bland "plane food" akin to hospital food. The meals that Air France offered were *glorious*; I've been at fancy restaurants that served up food much worse than the plane kitchen managed. Even my parents, who are legendarily picky about any food not from China, seemed to appreciate the fresh fruit and vegetables.

So that was a nice start to the trip, and in a small way we all looked forward a little more to eating in a foreign country and seeing what it had to offer.

We landed at Charles de Gaulle early in the morning, Paris time. None of us had slept very much, so we were all pretty bleary-eyed and tired at this point, and we had a whole day ahead of us! The airport was sort of a blur; we somehow managed to get our bags and find the guy who'd been sent out to drive us to our hotel. When we got near Paris, I was struck by how much the roadways reminded me of China: all the signage, how the highways were structured and marked, all of it was pretty much identical to what we'd seen in major Chinese cities. It was neat to find out that Chinese urban planners pretty obviously copied a lot of things directly from Europe.
