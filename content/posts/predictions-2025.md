### HSR

I'll assess these only if the CAHSR releases a new project update report, with new figures. (I think the next one is scheduled for early this year.) If they don't by the end of the year, I'll annul these predictions.

- P50 estimate of Bakersfield-Merced opening delayed to at least 2034: 60%
  - I consider the "P50 probability envelope" the official estimate, i.e. currently the official estimate is "end of 2033".
- Base YOE cost of Bakersfield-Merced rises to or above $33B: 70%
- Project officially cancelled: 20%
  - I'd consider any change to the project that abandons its current goal of serving SF-LA in <3hrs as cancelling it.
