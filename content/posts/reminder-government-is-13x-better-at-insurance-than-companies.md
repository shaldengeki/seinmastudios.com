Per a [KFF report](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/what-to-know-about-medicare-spending-and-financing/), the US government spent less than 1.3% of Medicare expenses on overhead in 2021 -- the remaining 98.7% went directly to paying for healthcare. For comparison, private Medicare (called "Medicare Advantage" by some) spent 17% on overhead, making the government ~13x more efficient at running healthcare insurance than private companies. Even this stacks the deck in favor of private companies; the 1.3% figure includes spending on _overseeing private Medicare_.


This isn't new, either -- the government has been much, much better than private companies at this for a long while.
