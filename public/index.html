      <h1><a href="https://seinmastudios.com/posts/spring-break/">Spring Break</a></h1>
      <p>&hellip; and I’m spending it at home, sleeping the days away. How wonderful is life?
So it turns out that my return transportation was arranged under the assumption that my spring break was two weeks instead of one, which is really puzzling. So now I’m getting back to O’Hare at 10PM on Sunday night, and there’s about a two-hour bus and train ride back from there, so… I’ll be getting back late, yeah.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://seinmastudios.com/posts/end-of-winter-quarter-update/">End of Winter Quarter Update</a></h1>
      <p>So we’re nearing the end of winter quarter. This week is finals, which means no classes but mass tests, and next week is spring break. Officially, winter quarter ends this Friday.
It’s been a long road. Winter quarter feels the longest at UChicago, for several reasons - the first being that it is the longest, technically. The weather is also absolutely terrible compared to the other two quarters. This is objective, by the way - no matter how much you enjoy winter weather, having to cross the Midway to and from the dining hall is a trial I wouldn’t put anyone through.</p>
