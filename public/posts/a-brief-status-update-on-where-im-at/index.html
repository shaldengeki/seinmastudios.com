    <p>I&rsquo;m currently with my parents for the weekend, and things have been really busy. As a result I haven&rsquo;t had the time to write this post I&rsquo;ve been turning over in my head; trust me, though, if we&rsquo;re at all acquainted it&rsquo;s worth the wait. I&rsquo;ll be here until Sunday, after which I&rsquo;ll be headed back to Chicago and should be able to give this post the thought it deserves. Tomorrow and Sunday, however, I&rsquo;ll probably run shorter policy-related posts as I feel like I&rsquo;ve focused a bit too much on communication recently.</p>
<p>After that, I start work! I&rsquo;m really excited to use <a href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a> on a formal basis and it&rsquo;ll be my second MVC framework after Rails, so hopefully the relationship will be a beneficial one. I&rsquo;ve also been looking forward to just <em>working in general</em> as I&rsquo;ve been out of the job market for almost a year now. Starting to get the itch to do something actually productive, y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p>In any case, here&rsquo;s the links for today! Please look forward to the posts in the coming days.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p><a href="http://gael-varoquaux.info/blog/?p=165"><strong>A status update for sk-learn</strong></a> - This is, in my opinion, one of the best machine learning libraries and toolkits out there. It&rsquo;s true that R is incredibly flexible, but the ease with which you can begin using sk-learn and iterating rapidly just blows any alternatives out of the water for me. To hear that major additions are in the pipeline is great.</p>
<p><a href="http://izbicki.me/blog/how-i-serve-150-free-lunches-for-less-than-20-cents-each-using-homebrew-equipment"><strong>How to serve 150 free meals for less than 20 cents each</strong></a> - Bravo to Food not Bombs for doing this; this is exactly the sort of innovation and practice that we need to see happen more frequently if we&rsquo;re to begin to reduce poverty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-emergency-room-is-not-health-insurance/2012/05/10/gIQADyDxFU_blog.html"><strong>The emergency room is not health insurance</strong></a> - Sarah Kliff does some excellent reporting on the limits of so-called &ldquo;free healthcare&rdquo;. The idea that the plight of the uninsured is mitigated significantly because of the federally-mandated obligations that hospitals have to provide a bare minimum of care always rung hollow to me, especially now that we&rsquo;re hearing more frequently about &ldquo;collection enforcement&rdquo; picking up in hospitals.</p>
