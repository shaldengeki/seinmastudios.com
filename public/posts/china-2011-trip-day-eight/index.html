    <p>Today (well, technically yesterday) was the start of our trip to Jiuzhaigou and Chongqing. We flew down at ~10am and arrived after a three-hour flight. It was 38C outside, and today was considered a cool day by Chongqing standards.</p>
<p>After checking out our hotel rooms, we rested for a bit in the heat until another family arrived - I think the kid&rsquo;s name was Thomas? - and then we went to have dinner, which turned out to be the spiciest hot pot I have ever had in my life.</p>
<p>Then we drove up to a vantage point overlooking the city center and took photos. It was pretty cool - though vertigo-inducing - to see the whole city at once laid out pretty majestically. Then we came back home at around 11pm and passed out.</p>
<p>Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>And I thought Beijing was hot. This place is sweltering. Gonna be fun running around in 40C+ heat sweating like crazy.</li>
<li>Beijing International Airport is pretty cool. Not just literally. When you walk in the ceiling slopes up and away from you, giving you the sense that this place is on a scale of its own.</li>
<li>Apparently the normal Chinese reaction to eating beyond your spiciness tolerances is to get a massive stomachache. I can&rsquo;t honestly say that that&rsquo;s happened to me before.</li>
<li>Chongqing is pretty huge. Population-wise obviously, but the city center may be larger and taller than Chicago. It&rsquo;s pretty cook to go to a city that basically nobody outside of Chinese people are aware about and realise that it&rsquo;s bigger than anything you&rsquo;ve ever experienced before by an order of magnitude.</li>
</ul>
