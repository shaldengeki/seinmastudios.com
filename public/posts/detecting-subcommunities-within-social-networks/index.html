    <p>I&rsquo;ve been an active member of an online social forum called End of the Internet for a few years now. The site is particularly interesting because it&rsquo;s both closed off to the public and has been relatively long-lived despite the lack of new users; the active posters on the site have been around since the site&rsquo;s founding in early 2004, and watching the topics of discussion shift as the userbase grows and ages has been really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that it would be really fun to generate a map of the social networks on the site, and in recent years the rise of niche-interest megatopics has been of particular concern to the site staff. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve been trying to find a metric that accurately describes the distance between users on this forum, and I think I&rsquo;ve finally hit upon something that gives sensible results.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I take the postcounts for a pair of users in all topics in which at least one of them has posted.</li>
<li>If the number of topics in which both of them have posted is less than some threshold (20), I throw this pair of users out and move on to the next pair.</li>
<li>Then I calculate Pearson&rsquo;s r (correlation coefficient) for this two-dimensional array of post counts. If it&rsquo;s above a certain level (0.2), then I place an edge connecting these two users, weighted by the value of Pearson&rsquo;s r.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards, I&rsquo;ve got a weighted map that I toss into <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> and run Forceatlas2 on for awhile to let the map come to equilibrium. Then I run the <a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0476v2.pdf">default clustering algorithm</a> in Gephi to assign each node to a community, and do a few small coloring/labeling touchups to make the graph look nice. I throw the resultant gexf file into <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">SigmaJS</a> and get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://seinmastudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/systemofyetis-1024x594.png" alt="ETI network graph for 2012"></p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? Each of these clusters corresponds to an actual niche on the site, which was <em>really</em> cool to see just fall out of the data. <a href="http://llanim.us/etiNetworkGraph.php">You can see an interactive version of the map here</a>. It&rsquo;s really interesting to see the degree to which the site has split into niche topics, and in particular it&rsquo;s kind of scary to see just how little each of the largest clusters links with the rest of the map.</p>
<p>There are some issues with the metric I&rsquo;m using; for one, it doesn&rsquo;t work particularly well for users that don&rsquo;t post in any particular niche megatopics, but nevertheless do have some friendships with users on the site. I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t figure out a way to incorporate them better into the network. In the meanwhile, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with how things turned out, and I&rsquo;m in the process of generating similar graphs for previous years.</p>
